\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

With the recent rise in high-performance computing, large-scale 
three-dimensional neutral particle transport is becoming more and more
commonplace. One usual solution approach is to discretize all of the
independent variables of the steady-state Boltzmann transport equation and
solve the resultant systems of equations. The classic discrete ordinates (\sn)
method is well-known and commonly used in deterministic transport, but it
frequently suffers from inaccuracies in scalar particle flux solutions
brought about by angular discretization (termed ``ray effects'').

The Lagrange Discrete Ordinates (LDO) equations, developed by Ahrens
\cite{ahrens}, are formally equivalent to the classic \sn\ equations and have
been shown to mitigate ray effects at high angular resolutions.
In this paper we will explore and assess deterministic scalar flux solutions
from the LDO equations, which have never before
been implemented in a full-scale radiation transport framework.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: background information
regarding the main components of this work is given, followed by descriptions
of the test case scenarios employed and the choices made in parameter selection
for the calculations performed. Numerical results are presented and discussed
and we close the paper with concluding remarks and suggestions for future work.

%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

We start by giving appropriate background information on constituent components
of this work. Primarily, we will briefly cover the Denovo radiation transport
solver and give a short introduction to the Lagrange Discrete Ordinates (LDO)
equations. As one of the points of interest in the LDO equations is their
unique handling of angular discretization and particle scattering, we will
focus discussions in such a way as to highlight the actualities and
implications of this difference.

%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\subsection{Denovo}

Denovo is a three-dimensional discrete ordinates radiation transport code
developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory \cite{denovo}. It is implemented in
the Exnihilo framework that allows for multiple combinations of spatial
discretizations, quadrature sets, and solution methods. The steady-state
Boltzmann transport equation solved in Denovo is

\begin{multline}
\bo \cdot \nabla \psi(\vecr,E,\bo) + \Sigma_t(\vecr,E) \psi(\vecr,E,\bo) = \\
\int_0^\infty\int_{4\pi} \Sigma_s(\vecr,E'\rightarrow E,\bo'\cdot\bo)
\psi(\vecr,E',\bo')d\bo'dE' + Q(\vecr,E,\bo),
\label{eq:bte}
\end{multline}

\noindent where $\psi$ denotes the angular flux, $\vecr$ is the particle
position in Cartesian coordinates, $E$ is the energy of the particle,
and $\bo$ is the unit vector of direction of travel of the particle. As it is
pertinent to the material presented here, we will briefly note the discrete
ordinates method employed in Denovo for angular discretization; full detail may
be found in Reference \cite{denovo}.

The \sn\ approximation used in Denovo is

\begin{multline}
\bo_a \cdot \nabla \psi_a^g(\vecr) + \Sigma_t^g(\vecr)\psi_a^g(\vecr) = \\
\sum_{g'=0}^{G}\sum_{\ell=0}^{N}\Sigma_{s,\ell}^{g'\sa g}(\vecr)
\bigg[\Ye{\ell 0}{a}\phi_{\ell 0}^{g'}(\vecr) + \sum_{m=1}^{\ell}
\bigg(\Ye{\ell m}{a}\phi_{\ell m}^{g'}(\vecr) \\
 + \Yo{\ell m}{n}\vartheta_{\ell m}^{g'}(\vecr)\bigg)\bigg]
+ Q_a^g(\vecr),
\label{eq:sn}
\end{multline}

\noindent where a standard multigroup energy approximation is used. $\phi$ and
$\vartheta$ are the moments of the angular flux and the angles are integrated
by a quadrature rule such that

\begin{equation}
\int_{4\pi} d\bo = \sum_{a=1}^{n}w_a = 4\pi.
\label{eq:quadrule}
\end{equation}

%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\subsection{Lagrange Discrete Ordinates (LDO) Equations}

The Lagrange Discrete Ordinates (LDO) equations are formally the same as the
traditional \sn\ equations but feature several distinct and important
differences. From the derivation in Reference \cite{ahrens}, they are written
as

\begin{multline}
\bo_n\cdot\nabla\psi_{n}(\vecr,E) + 
\Sigma_{t}(\vecr,E)\psi_{n}(\vecr,E) = \\
\int_0^\infty\sum_{m=1}^{N}\sum_{n'=1}^{N}\langle L_{n'},L_{m}\rangle
\Sigma_{s,L}(\vecr,E'\rightarrow E)(\bo_{m}\cdot\bo_n)\psi_{n'}(E')dE'
+ Q_{n}(E),
\end{multline}

\noindent where $N$ is the number of discrete angles used in the formulation
and is a property of the maximum degree of integration of the quadrature set
on which the equations are based, $L_n$ is the $n^{th}$ Lagrange function, and
$\Sigma_{s,L}$ is the scattering cross section restricted to maximum degree
$L$.

The notable differences between the LDO equations and the classical \sn\
equations can be summarized as:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{The LDO solution has an interpolatory structure in angle.}
\item{The LDO formulation does not require calculation of spherical harmonic
      moments.}
\item{The positive-weight quadrature sets on which the LDO equations are based
      can integrate spherical harmonics ranging from degree 0 to degree 165.}
\end{enumerate}

For a given fixed maximum degree of integration $L$, the corresponding number
of ordinates in the LDO formulation is $(L+1)^2$.

\section{Test Cases and Run Parameters}

First we will introduce the scenarios in which the LDO equations' scalar flux
solutions are compared to those of standard quadrature types. Then we will list
the various parameters used in the deterministic calculations.

%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\subsection{Steel Plate Embedded in Water}

The first test case we describe is an idealized geometry of a steel plate 
embedded in water; it is modeled after the scenario presented in Reference 
\cite{wilsonslaybaugh}. 
A diagram of the problem geometry is shown in Figure \ref{steelxz} and a list
of material properties used in the problem is given in Table \ref{steel-mat}.
In Figure \ref{steelxz}, the orange region contains the source material, the 
black region is composed of steel, the blue regions indicate water, and the 
white region is composed of air.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{img/steel-xz.png}
\caption{Steel plate in water geometry ($x-z$ slice through $y = 25$ cm) 
         \cite{wilsonslaybaugh}.}
\label{steelxz}
\end{figure}

The problem measurements are $53\times50\times140$ cm. The scenario is uniform 
in the $y$-direction and materials vary mainly in the $z$-direction. The source
region extends from 0 to 15 cm, the steel shield extends between 15 and 30 cm, 
the water and steel plate extend from 30 to 130 cm, and the air extends from 
130 to 140 cm. The steel plate is 3 cm wide and is centered at $x = 26.5$ cm. 
Vacuum boundary conditions were used at the problem boundaries.

A non-uniform Cartesian mesh was used for the spatial discretization in the 
deterministic calculations. In the $x$-direction, voxel width is 5 cm between
$x = 0$ cm and $x = 25$ cm, 0.5 cm between $x = 25$ cm and $x = 28$ cm, and 5 
cm between $x = 28$ cm and $x = 53$ cm. A uniform spacing of voxel width 1 cm 
was used in the $y$-direction. In the $z$-direction, the spatial cell width is
3 cm between $z = 0$ cm and $z = 30$ cm and 2 cm between $z = 30$ cm and 
$z = 140$ cm.

\end{table}

The composition of the neutron source block is a homogenization of water,
zirconium, and uranium and was calculated based on the geometry and composition
of the Rowlands UO$_2$ pin cell benchmark specification \cite{pincell}. The
source is a U-235 fission 
spectrum that is uniformly distributed throughout the homogenized material. The
compositions of air, carbon steel, and water were taken from the Compendium of 
Material Composition Data for Radiation Transport Modeling \cite{pnnl}.

%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\subsection{Dog-Legged Void Neutron (DLVN)}

The next problem modeled is the dog-legged void neutron (DLVN) experimental 
benchmark, which was designed to measure neutron streaming in iron with air
voids. The model used in the following calculations was constructed from
References \cite{sw-dlvn,j-dlvn,dlvn1991}. The two materials used in the
problem are elemental iron and polyethylene. The polyethylene composition used
was C$_2$H$_4$. This is listed as ``polyethylene, non-borated'' and is material
248 in Reference \cite{pnnl}. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{img/dlvn.png}
\caption{Centerline cutaway of DLVN setup \cite{sw-dlvn}.}
\label{dlvn}
\end{figure}

The problem measurements are $40\times54\times48$ inches. A uniform spatial
mesh was imposed over the entire problem, with voxels measuring 1 inch per side.
The neutron source in this problem is a Cf-252 point source located at the 
center of the $x-$ and $y-$directions and at $z = 9$ inches.
This point source was approximated as a small volumetric source in the tests in
this work.

The experimental configuration is symmetric about the $y-z$ plane at $x = 0$
and so is usually simulated with a reflecting boundary at $x = 0$ and vacuum
boundaries on all other sides of the configuration. For the tests in this work,
the use of reflecting boundary conditions was not available, so the model used 
was constructed to represent the entire experimental geometry configuration.
Vacuum boundary conditions were applied to the outside of the entire problem.

%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\subsection{Calculation Parameters}

All of the deterministic calculations used 32 processes on a 2.8GHz AMD 
Opteron\texttrademark\ 6320 Processor \cite{amd}, two for each logical CPU
unit. With this in mind, all deterministic calculations were set to use the
same Denovo computational block structure of 8 blocks 
in the $x-$dimension, 4 blocks in the $y-$dimension, and 1 block in the 
$z-$dimension; thus the total number of computational blocks equals the number
of processes. Denovo uses the Koch-Baker-Alcouffe (KBA) parallel sweep
algorithm for high parallel efficiency in calculating transport sweeps
\cite{denovo}; the aforementioned block structure was chosen to achieve the
same parallel performance among all test case deterministic simulations. 

The two test cases use the same coarse energy group structure specified in 
the ``27n19g'' library; the groups in this library are listed in Table A-1 of
Appendix A of the ADVANTG technical report \cite{advantg}. Because 
energy discretization is treated the same way between the traditional discrete
ordinates formulation and the LDO equations, it was assumed that energy group 
structure would not greatly impact the comparative results.
The step characteristics (SC) spatial discretization was used in all of the
calculations and all runs used a P$_5$ scattering expansion.

For the comparisons presented here, quadrature sets of similar angular mesh
refinement were chosen such that the quadrature sets have approximately the 
same total number of angles, with the exception of the Galerkin quadrature set.
The QR quadrature set is of order 4 and has 128 angles, the LDFE set is order 1
with 128 angles, and the LDO set is of order 11 with 144 angles. 
The Galerkin quadrature set chosen as the representative example here is of
order 4 and has 24 angles. This set was chosen because its corresponding \pn\
order is 5 and so the scattering data used matches that of the other quadrature
types. At the time of this writing, Galerkin quadrature sets are implemented in
the Exnihilo framework with the restriction that the \pn\ order be one greater
than the \sn\ order.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\subsection{Steel Plate Embedded in Water}

Figure \ref{steel-fwd-slices} shows a representative forward scalar flux slice
plot for each quadrature type. Each of the flux slices is at the midplane of
the $y-$dimension such that $y = 25$ cm. The geometry/material borders are
outlined on each plot as well. All plots show the same expected result -- the
scalar flux is highest in the source region and drops off by orders of
magnitude along the $z-$axis.

To more thoroughly evaluate the LDO quadrature set in this test case, we will
look more closely at the differences between the representative LDO flux and
the three other quadrature types. Figure \ref{steel-fwd-diff-rel} shows three
plots of relative flux differences; each plot compares the representative LDO
quadrature set against one of the standard quadrature set types. The relative
flux difference is calculated as

\begin{equation}
\phi_{\mathrm{diff}} = 
\frac{\left|\phi_{\mathrm{LDO}}-\phi_{\mathrm{ref}}\right|}{\phi_{\mathrm{ref}}}
\label{flux-diff}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\phi_{\mathrm{ref}}$ is the scalar flux calculated using the 
standard quadrature set and is taken to be the reference value. For all three
of the standard quadrature sets, the area of greatest agreement with the LDO
scalar flux is towards the bottom of the problem geometry, with discrepancies
growing along the $z-$axis. The greatest difference can be seen between the LDO
and Galerkin quadrature sets, while the LDO and QR quadrature sets agree best.
The area of greatest discrepancy between the QR and LDO flux solutions is in
the region of air just beyond the steel beam. We note here that this particular
deviation is most likely due to issues in processing iron cross section data
inherent to deterministic calculations \cite{wilsonslaybaugh}.

Table \ref{steel-fwd-diff-table} lists the minimum, maximum, and average
differences between various quadrature types for the flux slices plotted in
Figure \ref{steel-fwd-diff-rel}. We compare the representative LDO flux
solution to the solutions from the three standard representative quadrature
types and also compare the Galerkin and LDFE results against the QR result. On
average, the LDO forward flux solution matches the QR flux solution more
closely than it matches either the Galerkin or LDFE flux solutions.
Additionally, the LDO flux solution matches the QR flux solution more closely
than do either of the Galerkin and LDFE flux solutions.

\begin{table}[!hbt]

\caption{Steel plate forward scalar flux extremal and average relative differences.}
\label{steel-fwd-diff-table}
\begin{tabular}{l|ccc}

\rule{0pt}{2.6ex} \\

LDO/LDFE            & 5\E{-7}             & 2.7850\E{-1}       & 9.418\E{-2}      \\
Galerkin/QR         & 3\E{-5}             & 8.2364\E{-1}       & 2.903\E{-1}      \\
LDFE/QR             & 2\E{-7}             & 2.4807\E{-1}       & 9.632\E{-2}
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Looking at Figures \ref{steel-fwd-slices} and \ref{steel-fwd-diff-rel} we note
that the forward scalar flux solutions from the LDO equations capture the same
physical trends as the standard quadrature type solutions and also that the LDO
flux solution most closely matches that using the QR quadrature set.
Additionally, Table \ref{steel-fwd-diff-table} shows an average difference of
2.2\% between the plotted flux solutions from the representative LDO and QR
quadrature sets, which is the lowest average difference seen in the comparisons
here. As QR quadratures are commonly used for Monte Carlo variance reduction
parameter generation, the relative agreement of the LDO scalar flux with the QR
scalar flux motivates the exploration of the use of LDO scalar flux solutions
for Monte Carlo variance reduction parameter generation.

\subsection{Dog-Legged Void Neutron (DLVN)}

For the DLVN test case, we present flux slice plots for the same representative
quadrature sets. Although the entire DLVN
experimental geometry was simulated, here we plot only half of the
configuration; this is the typical view of the benchmark seen in the
literature.

Figure \ref{dlvn-fwd-slices} shows the forward scalar flux for each of the
representative quadrature sets at the midplane of $y = 27$ inches (68.58 cm).
Each of the plots has outlines of the material boundaries with the detector
locations delineated as well. As expected, the flux is highest at the neutron
source and decreases as particles move through the experimental configuration.
With this, we again look at the differences between the representative LDO flux
and the three other quadrature types. 

As with the previous test case, the flux differences 
are calculated with Equation \ref{flux-diff}. In the DLVN scenario, the 
differences stem from the source location. This is not surprising; the particle
source here is approximately a point source and so these differences appear in
the form of ray effects, where the discrete angles in the LDO quadrature set do
not overlap with the angles in a given standard quadrature set. Similar to the
steel plate in water test case, the LDO scalar flux best matches the QR scalar
flux and the largest differences are seen between the LDO and Galerkin scalar
flux plots. Looking at Figure \ref{dlvn-fwd-diff-gkn}, the areas of greatest
discrepancy appear as ray effects; the relative coarseness of the
representative Galerkin quadrature set angular mesh is likely the cause of
this. This is visibly pronounced in the DLVN case because of the geometrically
small particle source; it is also likely the source of the 
LDO/Galerkin discrepancy seen above for the steel plate embedded in water, but
ray effects are lessened in that scenario by the larger volumetric source.

Lastly, it is instructive to compare the results of the forward deterministic
scalar flux solutions with the experimentally measured flux values at the
detector locations. Table \ref{dlvn-fwd-det} lists the experimentally measured
\cite{dlvn1991} and deterministically calculated scalar flux values at the
detector locations noted in Figure \ref{dlvn}. Table \ref{dlvn-fwd-det-diff}
lists the percent differences between the deterministically calculated flux
values and experimentally determined flux values with the lowest difference
for each detector location emphasized.

Looking at Table \ref{dlvn-fwd-det-diff} we see that all of the calculated
values fall outside of the experimental uncertainty of five percent
\cite{dlvn1991}. The results from the LDO quadrature set most closely match the
experimental results for half of the detector locations, which is better than
any of the standard quadrature types tested here. Table
\ref{dlvn-fwd-diff-table} lists the extreme and average values
of the forward flux relative difference slices shown in Figure
\ref{dlvn-fwd-diff-rel} with Galerkin/QR and LDFE/QR comparisons included for
reference. We see that, on average, the LDO forward flux solution best matches
the QR forward flux solution. However, in this case, the LDFE flux solution
matches the QR flux solution better than the LDO flux solution on 
average (5\% difference versus 8.4\% difference).

\subsection{Summary}

For the test cases here, we have compared the forward scalar flux solutions
resultant from solving the LDO equations against those arising from solving the
traditional discrete ordinates equations with a small variety of standard
quadrature set types. In
each test case, the results from solving the LDO equations best matched those
from using the QR quadrature set in the traditional discrete ordinates
formulation. Additionally, for the benchmark test case, the LDO equations
produced results that were commensurate to those of all standard quadrature
sets when the deterministic results were compared against experimental values.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this work we have seen that the LDO equations' scalar flux solutions are
comparable to those of standard quadrature types. Of particular interest is
the proximity of the LDO solutions to the QR solutions, as QR scalar flux
solutions are commonly used for input in Monte Carlo variance reduction
parameter generation and a future publication will assess the LDO equations'
scalar flux solutions' efficacy as input for Monte Carlo calculation biasing.
